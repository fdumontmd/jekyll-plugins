# Jekyll Post Series plugin

This plugin's purpose is to group a sequence of posts into a single logical
unit called a series. For instance, a tutorial divided into parts, or a book
review with a post for each chapter, could be grouped as a series.

It is assumed that a post can only belong to a series. In a sense, a series
is a more specific grouping than a category or tag.

The plugin supports the creation of series, and make the posts in a series
available when rendering a post that belong to it.
